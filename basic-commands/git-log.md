# Git log

---
Now that we have made a few commits, we should take a look at the history of our repository. Git has another command for this:

```bash
git log
```



Git log shows us each commit in our repository history, along with the hash of the commit. We will learn a little more about these hashes later, but just know that git uses a commit's hash to uniquely identify it.
