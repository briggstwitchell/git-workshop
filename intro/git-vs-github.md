One common misconception surrounding git is that it is a part of GitHub, or that you can't use Git without GitHub. This is not true! 

You can use Git to track changes to any group of files you are working with. It's commonly used for software development, but you can use git to track pretty much anything.

## Okay, then what is GitHub?
<br>
[GitHub](https://github.com) is just a hosting service for git repositories. 

The same goes for GitLab, BitBucket, etc. We need these hosting websites to use git to collaborate with other software developers. 

We will be learning about using GitHub later in the workshop, but first, we need to know Git.
