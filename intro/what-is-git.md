# What even is git?

Git is a version control system. It's a program that keeps track of a project and any changes that happen within that project's directories. 

Git was created by Linus Torvalds, the guy who wrote the Linux kernel. Linus made Git to help him develop software. He calls it "the dumb version control system".

Git keeps a record of all the files in a certain folder so that you can go back to previous states of your project. 

These previous states are called __commits__. We will cover commits later, but for now, just think of each commit as a bread crumb. Git allows us to leave a trail of these bread crumbs so that we can find our way back if we get lost or make a mistake while we develop our software.
