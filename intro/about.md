# Who this workshop is for
---
* First time users of git: if you've never even heard of git, you're in the right place.
* Git beginners: If you've used git a bit, but don't really understand exactly what's going on when you do
* Beginning software developers (read: align students): If you're just getting started with software development, you need to know git!

# Workshop Format
---
This workshop will be a live demonstration of using the Git version control system.

I'm going to be creating a very simple web site from scratch, showing how to use Git to save my work, safely modify it, and collaborate with other developers. 

I encourage you to follow along on the workshop website, and to return here if you ever need a refresher.

I'll be using VSCode and the command line to create and modify files in this website project. If you'd like to follow me exactly, you should [download and install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).


If you don't have Git installed yet, you can follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

All commands used in this workshop can be run from the command line.
