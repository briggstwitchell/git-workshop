# Who this workshop is for
---
* First time users of git: if you've never even heard of git, you're in the right place.
* Git beginners: If you've used git a bit, but don't really understand exactly what's going on when you do
* Beginning software developers (read: align students): If you're just getting started with software development, you need to know git!

# Workshop Format
---
This workshop will be a live demonstration of using the git version control system.

I'm going to be creating a simple web site from scratch, showing how to use git to save my work, safely modify it, and collaborate with other developers. I'll be using VSCode and the command line quite a bit.

I encourage you to follow along on the workshop website, and to return here if you ever need a refresher!
