# Welcome to the git workshop!
{: .text-center}


### <u>Workshop Format</u>
<br>
This workshop will be a live demonstration of using the git version control system.

I'm going to be creating a simple web site from scratch, showing how to use git to save my work, safely modify it, and collaborate with other developers. I'll be using VSCode and the command line quite a bit.

I encourage you to follow along on the workshop website. 

## Workshop goals
- [ ] learn what git is and why we should use it
- [ ] learn the basic git commands
    - [ ] making a git repository
    - [ ] using git to track our work
- [ ] learn git collaboration
